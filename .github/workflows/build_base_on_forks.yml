# This workflow is required to experiment with container images on forks
# it will NEVER run on aristanetworks/avd and requires following env variables:
#     DEBUG_CONTAINER_ACTIONS = true
# The workflow supposed to be the exact replica of container_build_base.yml in a stable state
# but diff is allowed to support a longer experimental setup across different forks
