# This will create per-vni flood-lists. Set to true for leaf 1-2 and to false (in hostvars) for leaf3.

# Expectation is to see per-vni flood-lists on leaf 1-2 and a single flood-list on leaf3

# This will limit the potential flood-list entries to those in the Inventory Group referenced in dc_name
overlay_her_flood_list_scope: dc
# By the single flood list would contain all the vteps under unit_tests since they use a single fabric name.
# This would mean that every addition to unit_tests would change this config, so to avoid confusement, we limit
# the scope to the "dc".
