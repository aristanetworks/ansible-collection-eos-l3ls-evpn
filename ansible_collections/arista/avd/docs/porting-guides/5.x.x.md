# Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 5.x.x

Major releases of AVD can contain breaking changes. This porting guide addresses how to update your inventory
and playbooks to be compatible with new default behaviors and changed data models when upgrading from AVD 4.x versions.

!!! note
    To upgrade from AVD version 3.x, first upgrade to AVD 4.10 using the [Porting Guide for Ansible AVD 4.x.x](https://avd.arista.com/4.10/docs/porting-guides/4.x.x.html)
    and then upgrade to 5.x with this guide.

Users of `eos_designs` do not have to consider the changes in `eos_cli_config_gen`, since those adaptions are
built into `eos_designs`.

## Common changes

### Data model changes from "dict-of-dicts" to "list-of-dicts"

In AVD 4.0.0 and across both `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen`, *all* "dict-of-dicts" data models with user-defined keys were changed to "list-of-dicts".
In AVD 4.x inputs were auto-converted to the new data models.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the automatic conversion from dict-of-dicts has been removed, so it is required to update the input data to the new data models.

Errors will be raised for each data model not conforming to the list type when running AVD:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
<...>
ERROR! [host1]: 'Validation Error: access_lists': {'ACL-01': {'sequence_numbers': {10: {'actio<...abbreviated...>4 any'}}}} is not of type 'list'
```

As an example, `ethernet_interfaces` was changed from:

```yaml
ethernet_intefaces:
  Ethernet1:   # <-- User defined key
    <...>
```

to:

```yaml
ethernet_interfaces:
  - name: Ethernet1   # <-- "name" here is called the "primary_key" which must have a unique value across all list elements
    <...>
```

## Removal of Ansible plugins

The following ansible plugins have been removed from the `arista.avd` Ansible collection in v5.0.0.

| Plugin type | Plugin name | Replacement |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Filter | `arista.avd.hash_passphrase` | Use `arista.avd.snmp_hash` instead |
| Filter | `arista.avd.generate_esi` | Use Jinja string concatenation instead like `{{ <esi_prefix> ~ <short_esi> }}` |
| Filter | `arista.avd.generate_lacp_id` | Use the builtin `replace` filter instead like `{{ <short_esi> \| replace(':', '.') }}` |
| Filter | `arista.avd.generate_route_target` | Use the builtin `ansible.builtin.regex_replace` filter instead like `{{ <short_esi> \| ansible.builtin.regex_replace('(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', '\\1:\\2:\\3:\\4:\\5:\\6') }}` |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.deploy_to_cv` | Use `arista.avd.cv_workflow` instead |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.batch_template` | The internal `arista.avd.batch_template` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.validate_and_template` | The internal `arista.avd.validate_and_template` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd.yaml_templates_to_facts` | The internal `arista.avd.yaml_templates_to_facts` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |
| Action plugin/Module | `arista.avd._emit_warning` | The internal `arista.avd._emit_warning` action plugin is no longer used by AVD. The plugin is released as open source, so it can be copied and reused according to the license and copyright. |

### Removal of deprecated data models

The following data model keys have been removed from `eos_designs` in v5.0.0.

| Removed key | New key |
| ----------- | ------- |
| cvp_instance_ip | cvp_instance_ips |

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_cli_config_gen`

TODO: Level 3 sections for each change with details on how to migrate

### No auto-conversion of old data model for `router_bgp.redistribute_routes` and `router_bgp.vrfs[].redistribute_routes`

The change has been incorporated into `eos_designs`, so action is only required when defining new interfaces
with `structured_config`, `custom_structured_configuration_`, or when using `eos_cli_config_gen` directly.

The data models for `router_bgp.redistribute_routes` and `router_bgp.vrfs[].redistribute_routes` previously supported either a list of strings or a dict-of-dicts.
In AVD 4.0.0 this was changed to a list-of-dicts with automatic conversion from any of the previous models into the new model.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the automatic conversion from both of the previous models has been removed, so it is required to update the input data to the new data models.

=== "Old data models"

    ```yaml
    # Old list data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        - connected
        - static
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            - connected
            - static

    # Old dict-of-dicts data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        connected:
          route_map: connected-to-bgp
        static:
          route_map: static-to-bgp
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            connected:
              route_map: connected-to-bgp
            static:
              route_map: static-to-bgp
    ```

=== "New data model"

    ```yaml
    # New data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        - source_procol: connected
        - source_protocol: static
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            - source_procol: connected
            - source_protocol: static

    # New data model
    router_bgp:
      redistribute_routes:
        - source_protocol: connected
          route_map: connected-to-bgp
        - source_protocol: static
          route_map: static-to-bgp
      vrfs:
        - name: test
          redistribute_routes:
            - source_protocol: connected
              route_map: connected-to-bgp
            - source_protocol: static
              route_map: static-to-bgp
    ```

## Changes to role `arista.avd.eos_validate_state`

### Input for hardware tests have been updated

The inputs for the hardware test have changed.

```yaml
validation_role:
  xcvr_own_manufacturers:
    - Manufacturer 1
    - Manufacturer 2
  pwr_supply_states:
     - ok
     - notInserted
  fan_states:
     - ok
     - notInserted
```

should be replaced with:

```yaml
accepted_xcvr_manufacturers:
  - Manufacturer 1
  - Manufacturer 2
accepted_pwr_supply_states:
  - ok
  - notInserted
accepted_fan_states:
  - ok
  - notInserted
```

### Filtering tests using Ansible tags support was removed

The filtering of tests using Ansible tags has been removed, The `skip_tests` variable should be used instead. The `skip_tests` mechanism is much more granular and allow to filter at the test level.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/fabric-validate.yaml --skip-tags ntp,bgp_checks
```

should be replaced with the following input variables:

```yaml
skip_tests:
 - category: AvdTestNTP
 - category: AvdTestBGP
```

and the following command line:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/fabric-validate.yaml
```

The test categories are listed in the [role documentation](../../roles/eos_validate_state/README.md#test-categories)
