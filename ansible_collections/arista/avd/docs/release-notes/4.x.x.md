# Release Notes for Ansible AVD 4.x.x

- Documentation for AVD version `4.x.x` [available here](https://www.avd.sh/en/devel/)

## Release 4.0.0

### Changes to requirements

- AVD now requires ansible-core from **2.12.6** to **2.14.x** excluding **2.13.0**
!!! note
    Excluded version **2.13.0** has an issue in `ansible-core`, which is [fixed](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.13.1/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.13.rst#bugfixes) in **2.13.1**. Plugin loader will now load config data for plugin by name instead of by file to avoid issues with the same file being loaded under different names (Fully-Qualified-Collection-Name + short-name).

  If Ansible is installed using pip, a supported version can be installed with `pip3 install "ansible-core>=2.12.6,<2.15.0,!=2.13.0"`.
