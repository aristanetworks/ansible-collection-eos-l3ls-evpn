See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#removal-of-ansible-plugins) for details.

### Data model changes from "dict-of-dicts" to "list-of-dicts"

TODO: Removed type conversion

### All eos_designs and eos_cli_config_gen variables are always validated by schemas

In AVD 5.0.0, all `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen` keys are validated by schemas and execution will stop for any violations.
If additional custom keys are desired, a key starting with an underscore `_`, will be ignored.

### Breaking or behavioral changes in eos_cli_config_gen

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 5.x.x](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md)
for details.

TODO: add level4 sections for breaking changes outlining the change and referring to porting guide for migration.

#### Removal of schema in JSON format

The `eos_cli_config_gen.jsonschema.json` is no longer generated. This schema was not being used and had never been complete.

### Breaking or behavioral changes in eos_designs

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 5.x.x](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md)
for details.

TODO: add level4 sections for breaking changes outlining the change and referring to porting guide for migration.

#### Removal of schema in JSON format

The `eos_designs.jsonschema.json` is no longer generated. This schema was not being used and had never been complete.

### Other breaking or behavioral changes

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 5.x.x](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md)
for details.

TODO: add level4 sections for breaking changes outlining the change and referring to porting guide for migration.

### Breaking or behavioral changes in eos_validate_state

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `eos_validate_state` uses ANTA as backend, which will change the default behavior (same as setting `use_anta: true` in the latest AVD 4.x.x versions).
If you have not been using `use_anta: true` in latest versions of AVD 4.x.x, please go through the following sections for details on the changes.

Please report any issues on the GitHub [discussions board](https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/discussions).

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory, input variables or playbooks. See the [Porting guide for AVD 5.x.x](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md)
for details.

#### Loose mode is the only supported mode

In the previous implementation, loose mode was used by default to avoid stopping the playbook and hence the tests when they were run task by task in Ansible. It was possible to turn loose mode off with a variable that would make the playbook stop at the first failing tasks for whatever reason on each host.

Loose mode is now the default and all the tests are always run and the errors are all present in the final report.

- No porting guide entry.

#### Input for hardware tests have been updated

The inputs for the hardware test have changed. See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#input-for-hardware-tests-have-been-updated) for details.

#### Filtering tests using Ansible tags support was removed

Instead use the `skip_tests` mechanism. See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#filtering-tests-using-ansible-tags-support-was-removed) for details.

#### Changes to CSV and Markdown reports

- Hardware tests are now collapsed.
- Sorting of test results is now done per device as opposed to per category.
- Test categories, descriptions and inputs have been improved to follow ANTA.
- CSV report headers updated from `test_id,node,test_category,test_description,test,result,failure_reason` to `id,dut,categories,test,description,inputs,result,messages`
- Tests skipped by ANTA will be marked as `SKIPPED` in the final reports.

#### Undeployed devices

- All tests will be removed from the catalog for a device flagged as undeployed using the host level variable [`is_deployed: false`](https://avd.sh/en/stable/roles/eos_designs/docs/input-variables.html#flagging-a-device-as-not-deployed). Additionally, all tests take into account the `is_deployed` variable value and remove tests accordingly.

!!! warning
    Tests can also be automatically removed from the catalogs depending on the structured configuration of the devices. ANTA is therefore not aware of these tests and they will not appear in the final report. For example, the `AvdTestMLAG` tests will not be present in the test catalog of a device that does not have an MLAG configuration in its structured configuration.

#### BGP test change

- BGP tests will only run if `service_routing_protocols_model` is set to `multi-agent` in the structured configuration file.

!!! note
    Starting from version 4.30.1F, `service_routing_protocols_model` is set to `multi-agent` by default on EOS devices.

#### Inband management reachability test change

- Inband management reachability test has been refactored to support AVD inband management [data model](https://avd.sh/en/stable/roles/eos_designs/docs/input-variables.html#node-type-inband-management).
