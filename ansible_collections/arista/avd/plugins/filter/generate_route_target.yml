  short_description: Transforms short_esi `0303:0202:0101` to route-target format `03:03:02:02:01:01`
  description: Removes `:` and inserts new `:` for each two characters.
  positional: _input
  options:
    _input:
      description: Short ESI value as per AVD definition in eos_designs.
      type: string
      required: true
  deprecated:
    removed_in: "5.0.0"
    why: This filter is no longer used by AVD and is very simple to replace with a generic Jinja filter.
    alternative: |-
      Use the builtin `ansible.builtin.regex_replace` filter instead like
      `{{ <short_esi> | ansible.builtin.regex_replace('(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2}):(\\d{2})(\\d{2})', '\\1:\\2:\\3:\\4:\\5:\\6') }}`

EXAMPLES: |-
  ---
  rt: "{{ short_esi | arista.avd.generate_route_target }}"

RETURN:
  _value:
    description: String based on route-target format like 03:03:02:02:01:01
    type: string
