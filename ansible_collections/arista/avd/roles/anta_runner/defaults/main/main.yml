# Controls the scope of test generation by defining the boundary for device interactions.
# Tests will only be generated for devices within the same boundary level.
# For example, if the boundary is set to 'dc', reachability tests will not be generated between devices in different data centers.
# To use this feature, the devices must have the proper location metadata (fabric_name, pod_name, dc_name, rack) set in their structured configs.

# Global timeout for the ANTA runner. It is recommended to set this to a high value to avoid timeouts during large ANTA runs.

# ANTA runner batch size. This controls the number of devices that will be processed in parallel. 5-10 is a good starting point.
