    description: 'AVD currently supports 2 different data models for extended ACLs:


      - The legacy `access_lists` data model, for compatibility with existing deployments

      - The improved `ip_access_lists` data model, for access to more EOS features


      Both data models can coexists without conflicts, as different keys are used:
      `access_lists` vs `ip_access_lists`.

      Access list names must be unique.


      The legacy data model supports simplified ACL definition with `sequence` to
      `action` mapping:
