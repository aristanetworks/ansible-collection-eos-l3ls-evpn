The keys used to define Connected Endpoints are configurable using `connected_endpoints_keys`.

Endpoints connecting to the fabric can be grouped by using separate keys.
The keys can be customized to provide a better better organization or grouping of your data.

The connected endpoints keys should be defined in the top level group_vars for the fabric.
The default values will be overridden if defining this key, so it is recommended to copy the defaults and modify them.
