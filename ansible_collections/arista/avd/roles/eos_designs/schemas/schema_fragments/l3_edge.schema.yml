      The `l3_edge` data model can be used to configure extra L3 P2P links anywhere in the fabric.
      It can be between two switches that are already part of the fabric inventory, or it can be towards another device, where only one end of the link is on a switch in the fabric.
      Fabric switches can be types `l3leaf`, `spine` or `super-spine`.

      The data model supports using IP pools, Subnet per link or specifying the IP addresses manually.
      For BGP peerings the AS number must be specified.
      If the AS number is different than the AS number configured for the node, the local-as will be replaced on this BGP peering (`neighbor <ip> local-as <as> no-prepend replace-as`).

      Make sure to configure the variables in a group_vars file covering all devices mentioned in the data model.
