      CloudVision - Telemetry Agent (TerminAttr) configuration is optional
      You can either provide a list of IPs to target on-premise CloudVision cluster or
      use DNS name for your CloudVision as a Service instance. If you have both on-prem and
      CVaaS defined, only on-prem is going to be configured.
