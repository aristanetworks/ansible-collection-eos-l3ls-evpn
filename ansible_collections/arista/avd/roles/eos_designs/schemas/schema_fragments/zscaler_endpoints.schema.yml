      PREVIEW: These keys are in preview mode.

      Special data model used for WAN internet-exit integration with Zscaler.
      The model is supposed to be autofilled per-device using the `arista.avd.cv_zscaler_endpoints` Ansible lookup plugin.
      Example:
      ```yaml
      zscaler_endpoints: "{{ lookup('arista.avd.cv_zscaler_endpoints', cv_server="<optional servername>", cv_token="<optional token>") }}"
      ```
      The cv_server and cv_token options can be set as inventory variables instead of given as arguments. (Then they will also be used for cv_deploy)
