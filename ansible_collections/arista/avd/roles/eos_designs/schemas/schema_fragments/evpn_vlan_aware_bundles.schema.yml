    description: |-
      Enable vlan aware bundles for every EVPN MAC-VRF.
      If set to `true` all SVIs will be configured in a vlan-aware-bundle per VRF using the VRF name as the bundle name. All `l2vlans` will be configured as separate vlan-aware-bundles with the VLAN name as the bundle name.

      The `evpn_vlan_bundle` option under `svis` and `l2vlans` takes precedence and will override this behavior. Per svi/l2vlan `evpn_vlan_bundle` will also work when this setting is disabled, and will be useful for mixing vlan-aware-bundles with regular MAC-VRFs.
