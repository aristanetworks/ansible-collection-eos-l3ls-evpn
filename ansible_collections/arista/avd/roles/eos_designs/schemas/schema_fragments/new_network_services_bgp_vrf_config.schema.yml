      PREVIEW: This key is currently not supported

      Set this key to `true` in the node type to generate full BGP configuration
      for network services even when `evpn` is not in the address families
      (`evpn` is the default address family for `l3ls-evpn` but not for `l2ls`).

      This may introduce breaking changes to your configuration.
