      Custom EOS Structured Configuration keys can be set on any group or host_var level using the name
      of the corresponding `eos_cli_config_gen` key prefixed with content of `custom_structured_configuration_prefix`.
      The content of Custom Structured Configuration variables will be combined with the structured config generated by the eos_designs role.
      By default Lists are replaced and Dictionaries are updated. The combine is done recursively, so it is possible to update a sub-key of a variable set by
      `eos_designs` role already.
