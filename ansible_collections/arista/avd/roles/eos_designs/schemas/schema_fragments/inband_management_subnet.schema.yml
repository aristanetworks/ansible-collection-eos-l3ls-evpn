    description: |
      Optional IP subnet assigned to Inband Management SVI on l2leafs in default VRF.
      Parent l3leafs will have SVI with "ip virtual-router" and host-route injection based on ARP. This allows all l3leafs to reuse the same subnet
      SVI IP address will be assigned as follows:
      virtual-router: <subnet> + 1
      l3leaf A      : <subnet> + 2 (same IP on all l3leaf A)
      l3leaf B      : <subnet> + 3 (same IP on all l3leaf B)
      l2leafs       : <subnet> + 3 + <l2leaf id>
      GW on l2leafs : <subnet> + 1
      Assign range larger than total l2leafs + 5
