              This variable defines the Multi-chassis Link Aggregation (MLAG) algorithm used.
              The following MLAG algorithms are supported:
                - first_id: offset from pool is `(mlag_primary_id - 1) * 2`
                - odd_id: offset from pool is `(odd_id - 1) * 2`. Requires MLAG pair to have a node with odd and a node with an even ID
            valid_values:
              - "first_id"
              - "odd_id"
